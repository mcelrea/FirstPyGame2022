#Programming Notes

##Principles of Programming

Ideas and concepts to help you succeed in programming

- Always keep your program in a working state ***AT ALL TIMES***
- Attempt to code small additions. Don't implement too much detail or functionality
- Each idea/addition should be implemented in its own function definition
- Name functions and variables meaningfully
- If something breaks......***STOP***. Seek help, or begin to debug
- It is okay not to know how to do something! Look it up.

## Create Task Requirements

- **A Purpose** - why did you write this application
- **A List** - a list and how it reduced complexity or how you could not write the app without out
- **A Function**
  - *Sequence* - code that runs over several lined in order
  - *Selection* - if statements
  - *Iteration* - looping
  - *Parameter* - input to the function
    - This input must change the result of the function

### Parameter

What is a parameter.

```python
def function(x, y):
   #code
```
x and y in the above function defition are parameters
